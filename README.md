# DyRA: Dynamic Resolution Adjustment for Scale-robust Object Detection
<b>The current code version has some implementation issues. We will re-upload. </b>

* [PaperUpdate] Currently updating [PaperLink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17098) - To be more easy to read, almost done.
    * We will update the paper into the final version in ArviX!
    * [TODO] Update ArviX - more experiments will be added (May be March....?)
* See [TempLink](https://github.com/DyRATEMP/DyRA)
